# life
The classic Conway's Game of Life, implemented with the Ebiten game framework and improved for visual effect

This is expanded from an [example](https://ebiten.org/examples/life.html) on the Ebiten site, but with updated visual effects meant to evoke algae growth or other organic processes. It would probably make a nice screensaver. 

There also randomly revived cells each frame to keep the system for dying out, and you can also manually revive cells with a click of the mouse.

To run:

  `go build -o life`
  
  `./life`
